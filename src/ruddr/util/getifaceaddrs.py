"""Helper function for notifiers to look up IP addresses for the current
system's interfaces"""

# Netifaces is no longer currently maintained (looking for a new maintainer).
# But the last release was in 2021 and it's not that complex, especially the
# address lookup part, which hasn't been modified in several releases.
#
# If this gets to be a problem, a possible alternative is using ctypes or
# similar to call getifaddrs(3) directly, but that's basically what netifaces
# does already, in native C (and actually, it also has alternative
# implementations for Windows, AIX, and Solaris, which don't have getifaddrs).
#
# Some more information on this at:
# https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20743709/get-ipv6-addresses-in-linux-using-ioctl

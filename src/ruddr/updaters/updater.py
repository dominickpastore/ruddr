class TwoWayZoneUpdater(Updater):
    """Base class for updaters supporting protocols that are two-way and
    zone-based, that is:

    - The API supports fetching the current address(es) for hosts, either
      individually or by fetching whole zones
    - The API involves zones in some way, e.g. entire zones can be fetched or
      updated at once, or fetching/updating a single domain requires specifying
      its zone

    It's meant to be flexible enough for a variety of API styles. For example,
    some APIs may be very flexible, allowing individual domains' records to be
    fetched and updated. Others may be strictly zone-based, only providing APIs
    to fetch and replace entire zones. Still others may be a hybrid, with a
    way to fetch an entire zone but only update single domains. This class
    supports all of the above by allowing only the appropriate methods to be
    implemented.

    The update process for this type of updater works as follows:

    1. The list of hosts is organized into zones:

       - Hosts with hardcoded zone in the config are placed in that zone
       - If there are any hosts remaining, first try :meth:`get_zones` to
         get a list of zones, and assign zones from that. If there are still
         any hosts that don't fit into zones, it's a :exc:`PublishError`.
       - If :meth:`get_zones` is not implemented, any hosts without hardcoded
         zones are assigned to zones using the `public suffix list`_.

    2. For each zone:

       a. Fetch A/AAAA records for the zone

          - First try :meth:`fetch_zone_ipv4s`/:meth:`fetch_zone_ipv6s` to
            fetch records for the entire zone at once.
          - If that's not implemented, fetch records for each host using
            :meth:`fetch_subdomain_ipv4s`/:meth:`fetch_subdomain_ipv6s`.

       b. Create replacement records for the hosts to be updated. If there is
          not an existing record for a host, it's a :exc:`PublishError`. If
          there are multiple existing records, they are replaced with a single
          one for IPv4, and they are all updated for IPv6. Other records are
          left untouched.

       c. Write the A/AAAA records for the zone

          - Try :meth:`put_zone_ipv4s`/:meth:`put_zone_ipv6s` to write the
            entire zone at once, if implemented. (This is only tried if
            :meth:`fetch_zone_ipv4s`/:meth:`fetch_zone_ipv6s` was implemented.)
          - Otherwise, use
            :meth:`put_subdomain_ipv4`/:meth:`put_subdomain_ipv6s` to write
            each host's records.

           for example, myzone.provider.com, this allows Ruddr to get the

class TwoWayUpdater(TwoWayZoneUpdater):
    """Base class for updaters supporting protocols that are two-way and *not*
    zone-based, that is:

    - The API supports fetching the current address(es) for hosts, either
      individually or by fetching all domains in the account
    - The API has no concept of zones, meaning there are not zone-related API
      calls, nor is the zone required as a parameter for any other operation

    It's meant to be flexible enough for a variety of API styles. For example,
    most APIs will allow fetching and updating individual domains, but some
    may only provide a way to fetch or update all domains in the account at
    once. Still others may be a hybrid, requiring you to fetch all domains in
    the account but update domains individually. This class supports all of the
    above by allowing only the appropriate methods to be implemented.

    The update process for this type of updater works as follows:

    1. Fetch A/AAAA records

       - First try :meth:`fetch_all_ipv4s`/:meth:`fetch_all_ipv6s` to
         fetch records for the entire account at once.
       - If that's not implemented, fetch records for each host using
         :meth:`fetch_domain_ipv4s`/:meth:`fetch_domain_ipv6s`.

    2. Create replacement records for the hosts to be updated. If there is
       not an existing record for a host, it's a :exc:`PublishError`. If
       there are multiple existing records, they are replaced with a single
       one for IPv4, and they are all updated for IPv6. Other records (if there
       are any in the account) are left untouched.

    3. Write the A/AAAA records

       - Try :meth:`put_all_ipv4s`/:meth:`put_all_ipv6s` to write all records
         at once, if implemented. (This is only tried if
         :meth:`fetch_all_ipv4s`/:meth:`fetch_all_ipv6s` was implemented.)
       - Otherwise, use :meth:`put_domain_ipv4`/:meth:`put_domain_ipv6s` to
         write each host's records.

class OneWayUpdater(Updater):
    """Base class for updaters supporting protocols that are one-way, that is,
    the API has no way to obtain the current address for a host. Ruddr requires
    the current address for IPv6 updates since it only updates the prefix. This
    class handles that requirement either by using hardcoded IPv6 addresses or
    by looking up the current IPv6 address in DNS.

    The update process for this type of updater works as follows:

    1. The list of hosts to be updated is fetched from config.

       - For an IPv4 update, :meth:`publish_ipv4_one_host` is called for each
         host, and the process is done.
       - For an IPv6 update, the process continues with the next steps.

    2. For IPv6, Ruddr obtains a "current" address for each host ("current" in
       quotes because only the host portion of the address actually matters,
       since that's the part it needs to reuse).

       - If an address for the host is hardcoded in config, it uses that.
       - If an FQDN was provided for the host, it looks up that domain name in
         DNS, optionally at a specific nameserver.
       - Otherwise, if neither was given, it skips this host for IPv6 updates.

    3. Ruddr takes the host portion from each address in step 2 and combines it
       with the new prefix from the notifier to get the new address, then calls
       :meth:`publish_ipv6_one_host` on each one.

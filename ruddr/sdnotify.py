"""Python implementation of sd_notify(3)

The official python-systemd package on PyPI to notify systemd of daemon status
has not had a release since 2017 (it's near the end of 2021), despite having
several fixes since then, including a memory leak fix for notify().

There are a few alternatives:

1. Write a C extension module or use ctypes or CFFI or similar to tie in to
   the C call, sd_notify(3). This probably means using pkg-config, either in
   the build stage or at runtime, and not breaking when systemd isn't there.
   Lots of moving parts for a small feature. Bleh.
2. Use :func:`os.system` to call ``systemd-notify``.
3. Turns out the notify protocol is fairly straightforward, and just involves
   writing a simple string to a Unix socket provided in an environment
   variable. We can do that easily in pure Python.

So this module does option 3.

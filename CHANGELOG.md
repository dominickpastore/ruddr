Ruddr Changelog
===============

Ruddr uses [Semantic Versioning][semver]. In summary, new major versions
contain breaking changes, new minor versions contain new features, and new
patch versions contain bugfixes. (There is one minor deviation: Pre-release
versions will use [PEP 440][pep440] formatting, e.g.  "1.0.0b1", not the
hyphenated "1.0.0-beta.1" form specified by Semantic Versioning.)

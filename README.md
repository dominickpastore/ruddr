Overview
--------

Ruddr is a modular dynamic DNS client. It separates the job into two tasks:

- Detecting IP address changes, handled by *notifiers*.
- Publishing the changed addresses, handled by *updaters*

Ruddr provides built-in updaters and notifiers for common use cases and
services. For example, the `web` notifier will periodically query a
what-is-my-ip style website, and the `standard` updater uses the de facto
standard API, `http(s)://.../nic/update`, to publish updates for popular
services like DynDNS and NoIP.

If the built-in notifiers or updaters do not meet your needs, Ruddr makes it
easy to write your own and tie it into your configuration. (If you think your
custom notifier will be useful to others, feel free to submit a contribution!)

notifiers and updaters

own, see the [full documentation][docs].
